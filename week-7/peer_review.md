Problem description: 0 point

Exploratory data analysis: 2 points

Model training: 2 points

Exporting notebook to script: 1 point

Reproducibility: 1 point

Dependency and environment management: 2 points

Containerization: 2 points

Cloud deployment: 2 points

total: 13 points

Notes: 
Could have done hyperparameter optimization a little bit to get 3 points from model training, and in the notebook, markdowns could be used more creatively. Problem description is not enough, there is a description for the data, deployment and environment management, but no sign of any problem statements, just an overview section which explains the aim of the project. Except these, I can easily reproduce the scripts and understand the code. I like that you explain the evaluation metrics in the README. Nice project! Keep developing more!

Notes: 
I was able to clone the repo, activated the pipenv according to the instructions and checked if the packages are loaded correctly, but I wasn't able to run the notebook.ipynb, I tried to fix the errors, but I failed. It is really hard to read your notebook by the way. EDA is simple, I see a lot of visualizations and some feature engineering. I understand that you created the data yourself, but it's not appropriate to not do missing values and outlier analysis, they are a part of EDA.  I see that you have trained multiple models but there was no hyperparameter optimizations. train.py was empty. There is some instructions about model deployment, but I see no such thing like "predict.py" in your files. There is a Dockerfile, but it's incomplete as I can tell. There is no cloud deployment. Your evaluation points really check out with your Self-Check, but please don't lose your courage! You can still finish this project, even if it won't be evaluated. I believe in you!

Notes: 
I cloned the repo and loaded the pipenv without any problems. There is nothing like a problem statement or like that. I see that you trained multiple models, but no hyperparameter optimizations. For EDA there is missing value analysis and outlier detection and some visualizations with feature engineering, there could be a correlation matrix and feature importance analysis. There is no train.py script for me to run and reproduce the results. There is a script for web deployment with flask. There is a Dockerfile and info about containerization which seems to be working. Finally, there is no cloud deployment. I think you can do better, starting with your notebook order. Don't give up!
